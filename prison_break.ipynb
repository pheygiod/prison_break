There were no serious injuries reported.[63]'],['June 7, 2014', 'Orsainville Detention Facility, Quebec', 'Canada', 'Yes', 'Yves DenisDenis LefebvreSerge Pomerleau', 'Three detainees awaiting trial for murder escaped from a Quebec City prison at around 7:45\\xa0p.m. ET. The three detainees were identified as Yves Denis, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49.[64] The three men were arrested a couple weeks later and returned to the same facility from which they previously escaped.[65]'],['February 22, 2016', 'Thiva', 'Greece', 'No', 'Pola RoupaNikos Maziotis', \"A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison. In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014. According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis' wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers. Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.[66]\"],['July 1, 2018', 'Réau, near Paris', 'France', 'Yes', 'Rédoine Faïd', 'Faïd was helped by several heavily armed men who created a diversion at the prison entrance while the helicopter landed in the courtyard. The helicopter was hijacked along with the pilot, who was later released unharmed but in shock.[67]'],['September 25, 2020', 'Forest prison, Brussels', 'Belgium', 'No', 'Kristel A.', \"Three armed men hijacked a Eurocopter AS355 helicopter in Antwerp, Belgium. After take-off from Antwerp Airport, the pilot, a 35-year-old woman, was forced to fly to the women's prison of Forest. Unable to land, after more than an hour the pilot was forced to land the helicopter close to a highway carpark near the village Hélécine, 40\\xa0km east of Brussels. The three hijackers escaped, while the pilot afterwards flew the helicopter to the base of the Federal Police Air Support Detachment.[68] Four people were arrested two days later in connection with this helicopter hijacking.[69] Mike G., aged 24 from Tongeren, convicted drug dealer released out of jail but still under electronic surveillance, was arrested under the suspicion of having organised the failed prison break of his wife Kristel A., aged 27, who is awaiting trial for murder.[70]\"]]"
